## Description

React Portfolio is a single page application (SPA) that interacts with the browser by dynamically rewriting the current webpage with new data from the web server, instead of requiring the browser to load entirely new pages. React Router is used to make the application feel more like a traditional webpage. The application has reusable components, manages state within the components, and passes props to child components. Sections of the components are conditionally rendered based on updates to the state. This SPA was built using:

- React.js
- Node.js
- CSS
- Javascript
- React Router Dom package
- Jest package
- Gh-pages package
- Create React App package
