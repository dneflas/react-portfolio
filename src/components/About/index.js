        Hi, I'm Debbie - A full-stack web developer based in Culver City, CA
      </h5>
      <p>
        A full-stack web developer with a recently earned certificate in
        full-stack development from UCLA Extensions. I am Javascript-fluent with
        developed skills in Node.js, React.js, and mobile-first responsive
        design, with an eye for catching details. I have experience building
        single-page MERN stack applications. Iâ€™ve worked on teams of four to
        develop an inventory management application and a press-list management
        application for local businesses. I am looking forward to joining a
        quality-driven team to approach programming challenges from different
        angles, and to engage in meaningful development.
